# ThreatArtifacts
ThreatArtifacts is a cross-platform tool (covering Windows, Linux, and macOS) that monitors and correlates the critical artifacts left behind by adversary techniques. 
By extracting actionable clues from real or simulated attacks, ThreatArtifacts helps security teams rapidly develop or refine detection rules and deepen their insights into how threats unfold.
